TAKE CARE POINTS
================

1- Initialize variables correctly and also take the base cases. Like what if passed boundary cases.

2- free memeory, inlcude appropriate files

3- always mistakes in initialization, segmentation fault when run for first time -> may be not initialized, too many compilation errors

4-

RULE TO REMEMBER
================

Static C:
--------

- static global variables -> not accessible outside of source file
- static functions -> not accessible outside source file
- static local variabes -> like global variables (global scope) with local visibility

Static in C++
--------------

- static class variables -> are class variables, 
- Classes can also have static member functions.

Important in C++
----------------

Default constructor	       C::C();
Destructor	               C::~C();
Copy constructor	       C::C (const C&);
Copy assignment	           C& operator= (const C&);
Move constructor	       C::C (C&&);
Move assignment	           sC& operator= (C&&);


-> Default copy constructor is present in C++ (which just copy all the members, recall details) ==> shallow copy (pointer are same)

-> copy assignment = overload = operator for to perform as copy constructor  (a = b)

-> Always remember during AND if first is not TRUE second is not evaluated can be used in NULL case i.e. chance of null pointer exception in second

Polymorhism in C++
------------------

Virtual functions:-> it help in polymorhism e.g. we can call the instance class function using pointer to base class

  Polygon * ppoly1 = &rect;
  Polygon * ppoly2 = &trgl;
  Polygon * ppoly3 = &poly;
  cout << ppoly1->area() << '\n';
  cout << ppoly2->area() << '\n';
  cout << ppoly3->area() << '\n';

If not virtual only base class function called. A class that declares or inherits a virtual function is called a polymorphic class.

Abstract Base Class
-------------------
virtual member functions without definition (known as pure virtual functions)

Notice that area has no definition; this has been replaced by =0, which makes it a pure virtual function. Classes that contain at least one pure virtual function are known as abstract base classes.

Abstract base classes cannot be used to instantiate objects. Therefore, this last abstract base class version of Polygon could not be used to declare objects like:

Polygon mypolygon;

But OK

Polygon * ppoly1;
